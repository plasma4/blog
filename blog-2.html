# very fast car
What would happen if a car travelled at 220 million miles an hour?
Here are the constraints I set:
You are in Texas, and you travel at 220 million miles an hour, causing blueshift to switch the light from red to green. (This does indeed assume that the car is using space thrusters and the metal is indestructible.)

Combined with the help of the new smart Gemini 2.0 Flash model, I compiled a list:
After asking it back and forth a few times, I got a pretty good table! (You might need to zoom out though.)



|  | (Price point is billions to trillions, with 20 years of imprisonment) |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| __Law List__ | __Explanation of Violation in this Scenario__ | __Damage Level Relevance__ (see table) | __Estimated Jail Time__ (Max) | __Estimated Fines__ (Max) | __Sentence Summary__ |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Specific Texas/Federal Law Violated** | Speeding at 220 million mph on a suburban road with a likely speed limit of 25-45 mph. This is extreme speeding. | All Damage Levels | Up to 1 year (Misdemeanor A) | Up to $4,000 (Misdemeanor A) | "You violated Texas speed laws by operating at an astronomically illegal speed, demonstrating extreme disregard for limits and public safety." |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Texas Transportation Code § 545.351 (Maximum Speed Limit)** | Operating at 220 million mph on a suburban road is "willful or wanton disregard for safety." The speed itself defines extreme recklessness. | All Damage Levels | Up to 30 days (Misdemeanor B) | Up to $2,000 (Misdemeanor B) | "You endangered lives and property through reckless driving, exhibiting extreme disregard for safety and potential harm." |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Texas Transportation Code § 545.401 (Reckless Driving)** | Operating at this speed and firing thrusters in a populated area is essentially discharging a deadly weapon (the car) in the direction of others. Car \= deadly force. | Medium to High Damage Levels | Up to 1 year (Misdemeanor A) | Up to $4,000 (Misdemeanor A) | "You engaged in deadly conduct by operating a vehicle as a lethal instrument, placing others in imminent danger of serious bodily injury through extreme and reckless actions." |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Texas Penal Code § 22.05 (Deadly Conduct)** | Creating substantial risk of harm by extreme speed, even if no direct injury occurs initially. May be lesser included offense to Deadly Conduct. | All Damage Levels | Up to 90 days (Class C Misdemeanor) | Up to $500 (Class C Misdemeanor) | "You recklessly endangered others by creating a substantial risk of serious bodily injury through your actions, exhibiting extreme disregard for potential harm." |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Texas Penal Code § 19.07 (Reckless Endangerment)** | Sonic boom, blast radius, road destruction cause significant property damage. Felony if damage exceeds $30,000 (highly likely in Medium/High Damage zones). | Medium to High Damage Levels | Up to 10 years (Felony 2, if damage \> $30,000); Misdemeanor for lower damage | Up to $10,000 (Felony 2); Lower for misdemeanors | "You committed criminal mischief by damaging property, causing substantial financial loss due to widespread destruction resulting from your vehicle's operation at extreme speed." |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Texas Penal Code § 28.03 (Criminal Mischief) (depending on damage value \- felony threshold \>$30,000)** | Sonic boom and sustained extreme noise violate noise ordinances, disturbing peace. | All Damage Levels | Up to a few days (often Class C Misdemeanor) | Up to $500 (often Class C Misdemeanor) | "You violated local noise ordinances by creating excessive, disruptive noise exceeding permitted levels, disturbing community peace on a massive scale." |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Local Noise Ordinances (Texas Suburban Area)** | If deemed "aircraft" due to thrusters and road damage, operating without FAA registration is a federal felony. | Medium to High Damage Levels | Up to 3 years (Felony) | Fines vary significantly, potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars | "You violated federal aviation law by operating an unregistered aircraft, as your vehicle's capabilities and impact classify it as such under FAA regulations." |  |  |  |  |  |
| **49 U.S.C. § 44102 (Operating an Unregistered Aircraft)** | Operating an "aircraft" at 220 million mph in suburban airspace is extremely reckless, endangering the national airspace system. | Medium to High Damage Levels | Varies, civil penalties, potentially criminal in extreme cases | Fines vary significantly, tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars | "You violated federal aviation regulations by operating an aircraft in a careless and reckless manner, posing extreme danger to the national airspace system through your actions." |  |  |  |  |  |
| **14 C.F.R. § 91.13 (Careless or Reckless Operation of an Aircraft)** |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

| Creating a Hazard to Air Navigation (Implied in FAA's Mission & 14 C.F.R. § 91.13 \- Reckless Operation) | Creating an extreme hazard to air navigation through the massive blast radius, debris cloud, and sonic boom, endangering aircraft even if the vehicle itself is primarily ground-based. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
